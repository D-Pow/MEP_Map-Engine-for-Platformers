# MEP_Map-Engine-for-Platformers
A simple program for the creation of maps used in platforming games. Requires a premade tile set as a .png or .gif file.

#Controls:
<p>Arrow Keys: Shift map
<p>Shift + arrow keys: Extend map in that direction
<p>Alt + arrow keys: Shrink map from that side
<p>Ctrl + O: Open a previously saved map
<p>Ctrl + S: Save current map

Note:
Sometimes the shift, alt, and down buttons get stuck. If this happens, simply press the button again to unstick.
